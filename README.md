# Road-Accident-Dashboard
I'm sharing my First Excel Dashboard for the UK Road Accident Report.

This Dashboard presents significant information on Road accidents, including attributes like Vehicle type, Road conditions, and surface,
Urban/ Rural areas, speed, and Day / Night scenarios.

By using this, we can monitor accident hotspots and identify trends and patterns in road accidents from one location to another.

ROAD ACCIDENT ANALYSIS

STEPS IN PROJECT:-

Requirement Gathering from the client.
Identify the Stakeholders of the Project
Raw Data Overview
Connecting Data with Power BI
Data Cleaning as per the requirement.
Data Processing by adding some customized columns in the data.
Data Modelling

Insights


REQUIREMENT:-

Clients want to create a Road Accident Dashboard for the years 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight into the below requirements-

üëâ Primary KPI - Total Casualties and Total Accident values for the Current Year and YoY growth
üëâ Primary KPIs - Total Casualties by Accident Severity for Current Year and YoY growth 
üëâ Secondary KPIs - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type for Current Year
‚ùñ Monthly trend showing a comparison of casualties for the Current Year and the Previous Year
‚ùñ Casualties by Road Type for the Current Year
‚ùñ Current Year Casualties by Area/ Location & by Day/Night
‚ùñ Total Casualties and Total Accidents by Location
